                <p class="col"><b>Cup Noodle</b><br>This is a graphic design I did for
                my computer science class in ninth grade. I used the p5 website to make it.
            While it may not seem interesting when compared to other graphic designs,
        its one of the ones I'm most proud of</p>
                <p class="col"><b>Drawing of a Jar</b><br>This is a drawing I did for the Studio 
                Art Class I am currently taking. The teacher put a jar on a table and covered
            it with a blanket and told us to use it as a model to draw with. I was able to practice shading and
             perspective</p>
                <p class="col"><b>Mickey Mouse</b><br>This was another graphic design I did
                in ninth grade during my free time. It took 2 days to complete and a lot
            of effort was put into it. When I showed it ti my class I became the most popular
        kid for about 5 minutes</p>
